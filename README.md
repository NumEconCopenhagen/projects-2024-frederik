This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Danmarks Statistik**  and show various relationships between different types of wealth of people in different municipalities in Denmark.
3. Model project. We model a solow model with technology and human caiptal. We then introduce a shock in order to see how this affects the model.

*In all of our projects we have used copilot for inspiration and assisiting in the codeing
